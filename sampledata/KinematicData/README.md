This data was acquired from two cohorts of Parkinson's Disease patients to showcase the utilioty of VisionMD to assess the impacts of different therapies. 
Each patient was recorded twice, with their therapy "on" and with their therapy "off".
The following therapies were assessed:
1. <a href="https://github.com/mea-lab/VisionMD-Tutorial/tree/main/sampledata/KinematicData/DBS_Sample_Data.xlsx">Deep Bran Stimulation</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/mea-lab/VisionMD-Tutorial/tree/main/sampledata/KinematicData/MED_Sample_Data.xlsx">Dopaminergic Medication</a>
<br>
We also provide a <a href="https://github.com/mea-lab/VisionMD-Tutorial/tree/main/sampledata/KinematicData/data_analysis.ipynb">sample code</a> for statistical analysis to detect singificant different kienmatic features between 'on' and 'off' groups.
